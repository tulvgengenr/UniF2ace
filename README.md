## ðŸŽ‰ Key Contributions
+ A unified face understanding and generation framework: We introduce UniFÂ²ace, the first unified multimodal model for fine-grained face understanding and generation, establishing a solid baseline. 

+ A novel Dual Discrete Diffusion (D3Diff) loss function and a hybrid MoE architecture: We introduce D3Diff, a novel loss function within that theoretically unifies score-based diffusion and masked generative models, leading to a better approximation of the negative log-likelihood for high-fidelity generation and fine-grained attribute control. Additionally, we explore a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture at the token and sequence levels, adaptively incorporating the semantic and identity facial embeddings to complement the attribute forgotten phenomenon in representation evolvement.

+ We construct UniFÂ²aceD-1M, a dataset containing 1M VQAs with an automated pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFÂ²ace significantly outperforms or is on par with existing state-of-the-art models with a similar scale on various benchmarks, all while providing a more unified and efficient solution.
